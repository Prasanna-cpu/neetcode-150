# Find the Duplicate Number
# Solved
# You are given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers. Each integer in nums is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
#
# Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,2]
#
# Output: 2
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
#
# Output: 4
# Follow-up: Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using
# O
# (
# 1
# )
# O(1) extra space?
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= n <= 10000
# nums.length == n + 1
# 1 <= nums[i] <= n
